      <h3>Who stands before you?</h3>
      <p class="body">
        A xaela who's clearly spent most of his life away from his ancestral homelands.
        <br>
        <br>
        He stands tall, and his face has a propensity for stormy expressions. His voice is a deep baritone and his pronounciation is tinged with a Garlean lilt. Prominent canine teeth flash between his words, and his fingernails naturally grow into clawlike points - only trimmed back when he has the time and care for such trite matters. His build is lean, but he still possesses a wiry strength reminiscent of his warriorlike kin.
        <br>
        <br>
        The stench of smoke and ceruleum clings to him, reflective of long hours spent in workshops and around magitek. His posture says that he's seen battle, but the measured purpose and rigidity of his movements betray that his training was strict and regimented.

    <!-- PERSONALITY -->
    <div class="parallax-img" id="img2"></div>
    <div class="container-content">
      <p class="quote">"Tomorbaatar means 'iron hero'. Ganzorig is... Courageous, f-fearless, made of steel in th-that sense."</p>
      <h3>How does he act?</h3>
      <p class="body">
        Ganzorig tends to be a quiet but temperamental presence. Calm, observant, and efficient in the best of times. Yet easy to irritate. He is aloof and slow to trust, preferring to keep others at arm's length, stubbornly taciturn and rather curt.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though undeniably - and sometimes purposefully - difficult and cold, there is also an odd sense of kindness to the man. He often seeks to spend his time in relief efforts or charitable endeavours, seeming to find purpose in improving people's lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        That said, he can't forget old wounds. Though Ganzorig has had positive experiences with Garlean purebloods since finding freedom, he still harbors a deep distrust towards his erstwhile countrymen that's difficult to shake.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's a paradoxical existence that he lives, bearing philosophies and mannerims far too typically Garlean to truly divorce his idenity from the nation, much as he'd like to. A son born by the Steppe, yet raised by the Empire.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- HISTORY -->
    <div class="parallax-img" id="img3"></div>
    <div class="container-content">
      <p class="quote">"I deny calling you a 'seized dog', but there's something Garlean in you, like it or not."</p>
      <h3>What made the man?</h3>
      <p class="body">
        As a child, Ganzorig was taken from his home in Othard to be funnelled into conscription. Stripped of his original identity and given the Imperial name of Canis aan Potitus, then shuffled off to an orphanarium. Indoctrinated, trained, and promised the gift of prosperity in citizenship.
        <br>
        <br>
        The hope of that eventual gift, twenty years down the line, was what carried him until he was rotated into the XIIth, a brutal legion headed by a bloodthirsty tyrant of a legatus whose leadership promoted cruelty and violence even among the ranks. The orders of superiors were often senselessly sadistic and self-serving. Punishment for the slightest failure was nighmarish. Non-pureblood lives were thrown away first on the battlefield. Sick and insane experiments - too horrible to believe, yet all too belevable - swirled in the backdrop.
        <br>
        <br>
        His hope was a flimsy shield against that hell. The XIIth broke the man and left behind a hateful, miserable person who celebrated and abandoned his post when the Second War of Succession destroyed the Capital.
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps it was a twisted blessing, for he escaped the worst of the unspeakable turmoil that faced the city, taking refuge among ceruleum miners who had likewise been stolen from their homelands until the Eorzean Alliance swept in to evacuate their former enemy.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ganzorig now finds himself something of a drifter, searching for a life that takes him as far away from his days of conscription as possible. To pick at the sparse scraps of memories of his old home and reclaim the bits of himself that were stolen by the Empire. But, perhaps more desperately and deeply than anything else, he desires to atone for the orders he carried out under the auspices of the Emperor. To be able to say, when Death steals the light from his eyes, that his life was more of a blessing upon the world than a wretched blight.

    <!-- HOOKS -->
    <div class="parallax-img" id="img4"></div>
    <div class="container-content">
      <p class="quote">"The future for the sons and daughters of Garlemald is an uncertain one. That is to be sure."</p>
      <h3>Why do your paths meet?</h3>
      <ul class="body">
        <li>
          Is your character Garlean? Were they in the military, perhaps? Though he's shed his allegiance to Garlemald, Ganzorig is still easily pinned as someone who spent much of his life under the Empire. He can keep civil and hold his tongue when the situation calls for it, but excpect him to be on his guard and keenly distrustful of those who still identify with Garlemald.
        </li>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your character was in the XIIth Legion, they may have crossed paths and thus recognize him. Perhaps they had an amicable camraderie. Perhaps they have bad blood.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Alternatively, if your character was in Doma or Ala Mhigo, perhaps they encountered each other under the worst of circumstances -- war.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <li>
        Does your character hail from the Steppe? Are they learned of xaela culture or the old auri language? Ganzorig is a keen learner about his Steppe kin and their ways of life, having been denied the opportunity to learn much beyond some uncharitable claims and stereotypes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Does your character travel frequently? Ganzorig goes where fickle opportunity takes him, and often finds himself entangled in business that demands he journey the realm. Even for him, there's some relief in a travelling buddy or a friendly face, on the perilous corridors between settlements.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Is your character in need of someone who can tinker with magitek or machinery? Ganzorig studied engineering and has extensive experience in the field from serving the Imperial Army. He's happy to build, repair, maintain, and tweak. Watching him work, it almost seems like he's having fun.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Ganzorig is also capable of working as hired muscle. He's good with a gunblade and can take a few hits, but he tends to be far more reluctant to proffer his arms to serve the ends of stangers.
      </li>
        </ul>

            Hi. I take it that if you've read this much, you're interested in writing with me. Shoot me a message and we can hash out a scene. I can also RP over discord if that's more convenient. If we go that route, though, feel free to pester me if I take a while replying. Sometimes the depressive swings hit and I need a nudge.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I usually default to para-style RP, but I'm kind of a slow writer. Sometimes I find it tough to string words together in a way that feels satisfactory to me, or I need to mull over a character's reaction for a minute. I still try to keep the back-and-forth flowing at a decent pace, but it's worth mentioning.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Ideally this doesn't need to be said, but let's keep IC and OOC separate. Don't get weird on me.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            I'm not interested in ERP. Just not my thing. Romance can be fun, but don't roll right out of the gate with it. I like having a chance to know that our writing styles mesh, and prefer slow burns besides. This dude is the type of character who's tough to romance, anyway.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            If you see any wonky behaviour on this page, let me know! My aim is to have it nice and functional on most screens so that I can rip it apart and redesign the whole thing from scratch again on a 3AM whim.
